										<h1>The Hold-Up Problem</h1>
									</header>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic11.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>
										This part considers underinvestment problem under incomplete contract.
									</p>
									<header>
										<h2>The Basic Model</h2>
									</header>
									<p>First we introduce the concept of 'Relationship-specific investments'. Relationship-specific investments involve effort that increases the surplus that
										 can be generated only in a particular relationship. Imagine car producer and a supplier of car seats, electricity plant and coal mine, and arms manufacturer and ministry of defense.
									</p>
									<p>
										In such investments, it is normal that sellers are held up with the buyer or other way round. One party could have significant difficulty in changing terms, this party usually is the one with low bargaining power. 
										This party can be 'blackmailed' or 'exploited' in the future, which leads to underinvestment problem.
									</p>
									<header>
										<h3>Timing</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										Here we assume only the seller invests.
									</p>
									<p>
										Date 0: Buyer and seller write contract. <br>
										Date 1: Seller invests effort \(e\). This is a hidden action. <br>
										Date 2: Buyer's valuation \(v\) and seller's costs \(c\) are realised. No assumption on who observes what at this stage.<br>
										Date 3: Trade level \(x \in [0,1]\) and payment \(t\) are realised. These are verifiable.
									</p>
									<p>
										We further assume symmetric information at date 0, and there is no wealth constraint. Then, parties write contract that maximises the total surplus, and 
										divide the surplus with an up-front payment.
									</p>
									<p>
										There are two kinds of investments: self-investment and cross-investment. We call investments without direct externalities as self-investment. Under 
										this kind of investment, \(e\) influences the distribution of \(c\). If \(e\) influences the distribution of \(v\), then this is a cross-investment, since it's 
										investment with direct externalities.
									</p>
									
									<header>
										<h3>Payoffs</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										Buyer's payoff: 
										$$xv-t$$
									</p>
									<p>
										Seller's payoff:
										$$t-xc-k(e)$$
										where \(k(e)\) is the investment cost.
									</p>

									<header>
										<h3>First Best</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										We maximise the total surplus:
										$$\max_e (v-c)x - k(e)$$
										So the ex-post efficient level is:
										$$x^{FB}(c,v)=\begin{cases}1, \text{ if } c\leq v \\ 0, \text{ otherwise }\end{cases}$$
									</p>
									<p>
										Ex-ante efficient investment level, before \(v\) and \(c\) are realised:
										$$e^{FB}=\arg\max\{\mathbb{E}[(v-c)x^{FB}(c,v)|e]-k(e)\}$$
										This is to maximise the total surplus.
									</p>
									<p>
										Sometimes is difficult to attain both.
									</p>
									<header>
										<h3>Hold-Up Problem</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										Suppose ex ante the parties write no contract, and at date 2 buyer and seller both learn \(c\) and \(v\). Then by Coase theorem, ex-post efficient trade 
										decision \(x^{FB}(c,v)\) will be implemented at date 3. But, how will seller invests?
									</p>
									<p>
										If the seller has all the ex-post bargaining power, then he will extract all the gains from trade:
										$$(v-c)x^{FB}(c,v)$$
										So, the seller's investment incentive is in line with the incentive in the first best benchmark. He invests \(e=e^{FB}\).
									</p>
									<p>
										Now consider the other extreme where the seller has no ex-post bargaining power at all. Then the seller will get nothing at date 3. 
										So, he will have no incentive to invest: \(e=0\).
									</p>
									<p>
										Take the middle point of these two cases. If two parties have the same ex-post bargaining power, then they will equally divide the gains from trade. Then the seller 
										invests:
										$$\hat{e}=\arg\max\{\mathbb{E}[\frac{1}{2}(v-c)x^{FB}(c,v)|e]-k(e)\}$$
										In general, \(\hat{e}< e^{FB}\) as the seller gets only a fraction of the investment's return.
									</p>
									<p>
										Whenever the seller expects that he cannot get all, he under-invests. This is the hold-up problem. The question is then whether contracts can solve the hold up problem. If the 
										types are observable and verifiable, then the first best solution can always be attained by setting \(x=x^{FB}(c,v)\) and \(t=vx^{FB}(c,v)\). And the seller gets all.
									</p>
									<p>
										At date 0, the parties can divide the expected first-best surplus with a lump-sum payment according to their date 0 bargaining powers.
									</p>
