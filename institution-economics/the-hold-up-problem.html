										<h1>The Hold-Up Problem</h1>
									</header>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic11.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>
										This part considers underinvestment problem under incomplete contract.
									</p>
									<header>
										<h2>The Basic Model</h2>
									</header>
									<p>First we introduce the concept of 'Relationship-specific investments'. Relationship-specific investments involve effort that increases the surplus that
										 can be generated only in a particular relationship. Imagine car producer and a supplier of car seats, electricity plant and coal mine, and arms manufacturer and ministry of defense.
									</p>
									<p>
										In such investments, it is normal that sellers are held up with the buyer or other way round. One party could have significant difficulty in changing terms, this party usually is the one with low bargaining power. 
										This party can be 'blackmailed' or 'exploited' in the future, which leads to underinvestment problem.
									</p>
									<header>
										<h3>Timing</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										Here we assume only the seller invests.
									</p>
									<p>
										Date 0: Buyer and seller write contract. <br>
										Date 1: Seller invests effort \(e\). This is a hidden action. <br>
										Date 2: Buyer's valuation \(v\) and seller's costs \(c\) are realised. No assumption on who observes what at this stage.<br>
										Date 3: Trade level \(x \in [0,1]\) and payment \(t\) are realised. These are verifiable.
									</p>
									<p>
										We further assume symmetric information at date 0, and there is no wealth constraint. Then, parties write contract that maximises the total surplus, and 
										divide the surplus with an up-front payment.
									</p>
									<p>
										There are two kinds of investments: self-investment and cross-investment. We call investments without direct externalities as self-investment. Under 
										this kind of investment, \(e\) influences the distribution of \(c\). If \(e\) influences the distribution of \(v\), then this is a cross-investment, since it's 
										investment with direct externalities.
									</p>
									
									<header>
										<h3>Payoffs</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										Buyer's payoff: 
										$$xv-t$$
									</p>
									<p>
										Seller's payoff:
										$$t-xc-k(e)$$
										where \(k(e)\) is the investment cost.
									</p>

									<header>
										<h3>First Best</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										We maximise the total surplus:
										$$\max_e (v-c)x - k(e)$$
										So the ex-post efficient level is:
										$$x^{FB}(c,v)=\begin{cases}1, \text{ if } c\leq v \\ 0, \text{ otherwise }\end{cases}$$
									</p>
									<p>
										Ex-ante efficient investment level, before \(v\) and \(c\) are realised:
										$$e^{FB}=\arg\max\{\mathbb{E}[(v-c)x^{FB}(c,v)|e]-k(e)\}$$
										This is to maximise the total surplus.
									</p>
									<p>
										Sometimes is difficult to attain both.
									</p>
									<header>
										<h3>Hold-Up Problem</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										Suppose ex ante the parties write no contract, and at date 2 buyer and seller both learn \(c\) and \(v\). Then by Coase theorem, ex-post efficient trade 
										decision \(x^{FB}(c,v)\) will be implemented at date 3. But, how will seller invests?
									</p>
									<p>
										If the seller has all the ex-post bargaining power, then he will extract all the gains from trade:
										$$(v-c)x^{FB}(c,v)$$
										So, the seller's investment incentive is in line with the incentive in the first best benchmark. He invests \(e=e^{FB}\).
									</p>
									<p>
										Now consider the other extreme where the seller has no ex-post bargaining power at all. Then the seller will get nothing at date 3. 
										So, he will have no incentive to invest: \(e=0\).
									</p>
									<p>
										Take the middle point of these two cases. If two parties have the same ex-post bargaining power, then they will equally divide the gains from trade. Then the seller 
										invests:
										$$\hat{e}=\arg\max\{\mathbb{E}[\frac{1}{2}(v-c)x^{FB}(c,v)|e]-k(e)\}$$
										In general, \(\hat{e}< e^{FB}\) as the seller gets only a fraction of the investment's return.
									</p>
									<p>
										Whenever the seller expects that he cannot get all, he under-invests. This is the hold-up problem. The question is then whether contracts can solve the hold up problem. If the 
										types are observable and verifiable, then the first best solution can always be attained by setting \(x=x^{FB}(c,v)\) and \(t=vx^{FB}(c,v)\). And the seller gets all.
									</p>
									<p>
										At date 0, the parties can divide the expected first-best surplus with a lump-sum payment according to their date 0 bargaining powers.
									</p>

									<header>
										<h2>Observable but Non-verifiable Information</h2>
									</header>
									<p>
										At date 2, both parties observe \(c\) and \(v\). But these are not verifiable by a third party, indicating an incomplete contract can occur, as there is no reason of 
										contracting on characteristics that are not possible to verify by the third party.
									</p>
									<p>
										We can attain the first-best solution by an option contract.
									</p>
									
									<header>
										<h3>Option Contract</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										After \(c\) and \(v\) are realised, the seller announces a price \(p\). The buyer has the option to buy the good at the strike price \(p\).
									</p>
									<p>
										To see how the contract implements the first-best solution, do the following backward induction: <br>
										- The buyer will buy the good iff \(v\geq p\). <br>
										- If \(v \geq c\), the seller announces \(p=v\), so the buyer will exercise the option. <br>
										- If \(v < c\), the seller announce a price \(p\geq c\), so the buyer will not exercise the option.
									</p>
									<p>
										Then, in equilibrium the first-best trading rule \(x=x^{FB}(c,v)\) is implemented, and the seller's expected payoff is:
										$$\mathbb{E}[(v-c)x^{FB}(c,v)|e]-k(e)$$
										Thus, the seller chooses \(e=e^{FB}\).
									</p>

									<header>
										<h2>Private Information and Self-Investments</h2>
									</header>

									<p>
										The independently distributed random variables \(c\) and \(v\) are now private information of the seller and the buyer respectively. The seller's investment only affects the distribution of \(c\).
									</p>
									<p>
										The following contract can implement the first-best trading rule.
									</p>

									<header>
										<h3>Contract</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										After \(c\) and \(v\) are realised, the seller announces \(\hat{c}\). Then the buyer chooses a quantity \(x\) and must make the following payment to the seller:
										$$t=\hat{c}x+\mathbb{E}_v[(v-\hat{c})x^{FB}(\hat{c},v)]$$
									</p>
									<p>
										Suppose the seller has announced \(\hat{c}\). The buyer then chooses \(x\) in order to maximise his payoff:
										$$vx-t=(v-\hat{c})x-\mathbb{E}_v[(v-\hat{c})x^{FB}(\hat{c},v)]$$
										Notice that the expectation is a constant, thus the buyer chooses \(x=x^{FB}(\hat{c},v)\).
									</p>
									<p>
										The seller can anticipate \(x=x^{FB}(\hat{c},v)\). Given this anticipation, the seller announces \(\hat{c}\) in order to maximise his expected payoff (incentive compatibility):
										$$\mathbb{E}_v[t-cx^{FB}(\hat{c},v)]-k(e)=\mathbb{E}_v[\hat{c}x^{FB}(\hat{c},v)+\mathbb{E}_v[(v-\hat{c})x^{FB}(\hat{c},v)]-cx^{FB}(\hat{c},v)]-k(e)$$
										$$=\mathbb{E}_v[(v-c)x^{FB}(\hat{c},v)]-k(e)$$
										Therefore, the seller gets optimal payoff when truthfully announces \(\hat{c}=c\).
									</p>
									<p>
										Then, the seller chooses \(e\) in order to maximise:
										$$\mathbb{E}_v[(v-c)x^{FB}(c,v)]-k(e)$$
										And \(e=e^{FB}\) gives the maximum.
									</p>
									
									<header>
										<h2>Private Information and Cross-Investments</h2>
									</header>
									<p>
										Now, the seller's investment can affect the distribution of \(v\), i.e. buyer's valuation. In particular: <br>
										Date 1: the seller chooses \(e \in [0,1]\), the costs are \(k(e)=\frac{1}{2}e^2\). <br>
										Date 2: only the buyer learns the realisation of \(v \in \{v_L, v_H\}\), where \(0\leq v_L < v_H < 1\) and \(Pr\{v=v_H\}=e\).
									</p>
									<p>
										Assume here that \(c\geq 0\) is commonly known. According to \(c\), consider two cases.
									</p>

									<header>
										<h3>Higher Cost: \(v_L< c< v_H\)</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										In this case, the first-best solution is:
										$$x^{FB}(c,v_L)=0$$
										$$x^{FB}(c,v_H)=1$$
										$$e^{FB}=\arg\max\mathbb{E}[(v-c)x^{FB}(c,v)|e]-k(e)$$
										$$=\arg\max e(v_H-c)-\frac{1}{2}e^2=v_H-c$$
									</p>
									<p>
										The following contract can attain the first-best solution:
									</p>
									<header>
										<h4>Contract</h4>
									</header>
									<p>
										Let \(p=v_H\). At date 3, the buyer has the option to buy the good at price \(p\).
									</p>
									<p>
										To see how this contract attain the first-best solution, notice that the buyer will exercises the option iff \(v=v_H\). Therefore, the first-best trading rule is attained.
									</p>
									<p>
										Further, the seller invests \(e\) in order to maximise his expected payoff:
										$$\mathbb{E}[(p-c)x^{FB}(c,v)|e]-k(e)=e(p-c)-\frac{1}{2}e^2$$
										$$\Rightarrow e=p-c=v_H-c=e^{FB}$$
									</p>
									<p>
										So the first-best solution is attained.
									</p>

									<header>
										<h3>Lower Cost: \(c< v_L\)</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										In this case, the first-best solution cannot be attained. First derive the first-best solution: 
										$$x^{FB}(c,v_L)=x^{FB}(c,v_H)=1$$
										$$e^{FB}=\arg\max\mathbb{E}[(v-c)x^{FB}(c,v)|e]-k(e)$$
										$$=\arg\max \{e(v_H-c)+(1-e)(v_L-c)-\frac{1}{2}e^2\}=v_H-v_L$$
									</p>
									<p>
										Then, by revelation principal, only consider the direct mechanism relying on the truthful reveal of \(v\). By direct mechanism, make the following notation:
										$$t(v_L)=t_L$$
										$$t(v_H)=t_H$$
										$$x(v_L)=x_L$$
										$$x(v_H)=x_H$$
										To ensure the buyer reveals \(v\) truthfully, we need the following incentive compatibility constraints:
										$$v_Hx_H-t_H \geq v_Hx_L-t_L \tag{IC_H}$$
										$$v_Lx_L-t_L \geq v_Lx_H-t_H \tag{IC_L}$$
										We can rewrite the constraints as follows: 
										$$t_H-t_L \leq v_H(x_H-x_L)$$
										$$t_H-t_L \geq v_L(x_H-x_L)$$
									</p>
									<p>
										If we want to implement the first-best trading rule, we need \(x_H=x_L=1\). Then we have:
										$$0\leq t_H-t_L \leq 0$$
										$$\Rightarrow t_L=t_H=T$$
										where \(T\) is some constant.
									</p>
									<p>
										However, the ex-ante efficient investment cannot be implemented. The seller chooses \(e\) to maximise:
										$$\mathbb{E}[t(v)-cx(v)|e]-k(e)=T-c-\frac{1}{2}e^2$$
										So, the seller chooses \(e=0\).
