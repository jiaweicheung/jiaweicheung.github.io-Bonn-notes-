										<h1>Overcoming Akerlof</h1>
									</header>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic11.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>Some prerequisite for this section is signalling games. If confused with concepts such as pooling equilibrium and separating equilibrium, please refer to a game theory introductory book or the slides provided on lecture.</p>
									<header>
										<h2>Warranties</h2>
									</header>
									<p>Warranties can be a signal of quality and hence may get around market contraction due to asymmetric information.</p>
									<header>
										<h3>General Setup</h3>
									</header>
									<p>Assume 2 potential levels of expected quality of a second hand car: \(\bar{s}\) as the high quality and \(\underline{s}\) as the low quality. Further use \(r\) and \(q\) to denote the probability of broken down, in particular:
										$$\bar{s}=r\cdot 1 +(1-r)\cdot 0 \text{ with probability } \alpha$$
										$$\underline{s}=q\cdot 1 +(1-q)\cdot 0 \text{ with probability } 1-\alpha$$
										where \(r>q\), i.e. a good car has a higher probability of functioning well. If a car functions well, then it's value is \(1\). Otherwise, it's \(0\). \(\alpha\) is the ex-ante probability that a car is good.
									</p>
									<p>Moreover, a car can be repair at cost \(c\) if broken, which can restore it's value to \(1\). The seller can issue warranties (a commitment to repair the car). Denote this decision by \(w\), where \(w=1\) if with warranty, and \(w=0\) if without warranty.</p>
									<p>Denote the valuation of seller and buyer as \(\theta_1\) and \(\theta_2\) respectively. To guarantee the possibility of trade, assume \(\theta_1< \theta_2\).</p>
									<header>
										<h3>Akerlof's Problem</h3>
									</header>
									<p>First of all, put warranties aside. On \(c\), we can distinguish two cases: if \(c< \theta_1\), the repairing is ex-post efficient; if \(c> \theta_1\), the repairing is ex-post inefficient. Both of the efficiency conclusions are regardless of the ownership.</p>
									<header>
										<h4>Case 1: Ex-post efficient repair (\(c< \theta_2\))</h4>
									</header>
									<p>In this case seller is willing to sell the car if the value minus the expected cost of repair is less than the price. The car will always have value of \(1\). Even if it broken, it can be restored to \(1\). Then seller of good car is willing to sell if:
										$$\theta_1-(1-r)c\leq p \Rightarrow \theta_1-(1-q)c\leq p$$
										since \(r> q\), if the good car owner is willing to sell at price \(p\), then the bad car own is also willing to sell at price \(p\).
									</p>
									<p>Then, buyer can infer from a price higher than \(\theta_1-(1-r)c\) that the expected cost of repairing the car is: 
										$$(\alpha(1-r)+(1-\alpha)(1-q))c$$
										the buyer is thus willing to buy if:
										$$\theta_2-(\alpha(1-r)+(1-\alpha)(1-q))\geq p$$
									</p>
									<p>Then, combine two inequalities, there can be trade iff
										$$\theta_2\geq \theta_1+(1-\alpha)(r-q)c > \theta_1$$
									</p>
									<p>So, the condition for trade is stricter than efficient. In specific, if \(\theta_2< \theta_1+(1-\alpha)(r-q)c\), then the good car owners will not sell their cars and the market outcome is inefficient. On the other hand, the lowest quality is always possible to be traded at low prices.</p>
									<header>
										<h4>Case 2: Ex-post inefficient repair (\(c> \theta_2\))</h4>
									</header>
									<p>In this case, no one wants to repair the car. The expected value of the car is then a convex combination between \(0\) and \(1\) according to the probability of well functioning. The seller of a good car is willing to sell if:
										$$r\theta_1\leq p \Rightarrow q\theta_1< p$$
										Given the good car owner is willing to sell, the bad car seller is also willing to sell.
									</p>
									<p>The buyer can then infer from the price satisfying the above inequality that the average quality of the car is:
										$$\alpha r+(1-\alpha)q$$
										Thus the buyer is willing to buy if:
										$$(\alpha r+(1-\alpha)q)\theta_2 \geq p$$
									</p>
									<p>Combining the two inequalities, there can be trade (a price \(p\) that satisfies both inequalities) iff:
										$$\theta_2\geq\frac{r}{\alpha r+(1-\alpha)q}\theta_1$$
										since \(r> q\), \(\frac{r}{\alpha r+(1-\alpha)q}>1\). 
									</p>
									<p>Again, the condition for trade is stricter than the first best case. The market outcome is inefficient if \(\theta_2> \frac{r}{\alpha r+(1-\alpha)q}\theta_1\), supported by the fact that the good car are not traded.
										Same as before, it is always possible to trade bad car at a low price.
									</p>
									<header>
										<h3>Gameform, Strategies, and Equilibrium Concept</h3>
									</header>
									<p>Here, assume there are one seller and two buyers.</p>
									<header>
										<h4>Timing</h4>
									</header>
									<p>
										S1: Nature decides the quality of the car. <br>
										S2: Seller observes the quality and then decide on warranty. <br>
										S3: Buyers without knowing the quality propose a price. <br>
										S4: Seller decides whether to accept any price. Trade may or may not occur.
									</p>
									<header>
										<h4>Strategies and Beliefs</h4>
									</header>
									<p>A buyer's strategy is a mapping from warranty decision to price offers:
										$$p: \{0,1\}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$$
									</p>
									<p>A seller's strategy consists of a mapping from qualities (types) to warranty decisions, and an acceptance rule: a mapping from types, warranty choice and prices to the offer to accept (or keep the car):
										$$w: \{\underline{s}, \bar{s}\} \rightarrow \{0,1\}$$
										$$a: \{\underline{s}, \bar{s}\}\times\{0,1\}\times\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}\rightarrow \{0,1,2\}$$
										where \(0\) is reject both offers while \(1\) is accept buyer 1's price, and \(2\) is accept buyer 2's price.
									</p>
									<p>Buyers does not know the seller's type (the quality of the car), so we define the belief as the possibility that the car is good conditional on warranty decision:
										$$\mu: \{0,1\} \rightarrow  [0,1]$$ 
									</p>

										<h4>Perfect Bayesian Equilibrium</h4>
