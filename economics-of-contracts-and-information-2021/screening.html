										<h1>Screening</h1>

									<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic11.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>
										Consider screening by an insurance context.
									</p>
									<header>
										<h2>Equilibrium in Competitive Insurance Markets</h2>
									</header>
									<p>
										Consider a competitive version of Stiglitz's (1977) two-type model.
									</p>
									<header>
										<h3>Basic Model</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										Consider a two persons economy, with one risk neutral insurance company and one risk averse customer.
									</p>
									<p>
										Denote customer's wealth in case of accident absent insurance as:
										$$W-d$$
										So, \(W\) is the original wealth level, and \(d\) represents damage in an accident.
									</p>
									<p>
										With insurance contract \(\alpha=(\alpha_1, \alpha_2)\), denote the individual's wealth as:
										$$W_1 = W-\alpha_1$$
										$$W_2 = W-d+\alpha_2$$
										where \(W_1\) is wealth if no accident occurs, and \(\alpha_1\) is the premium paid to the insurance company. \(W_2\) is the wealth level with accident, and \(\alpha_2\) is the net
										reimbursement.
									</p>
									<p>
										Perfect insurance if:
										$$W_1=W_2 \Leftrightarrow W-\alpha_1=W-d+\alpha_2$$
									</p>
									<header>
										<h3>Demand for Insurance</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										The individual's utility is (or a contract \(\alpha\) is worth):
										$$V(p,\alpha)=\hat{V}(p, W_1, W_2)=(1-p)U(W_1)+pU(W_2)=\hat{V}(p, W-\alpha_1, W-d+\alpha_2)$$
										where \(p\) is the accident probability. By risk averse, \(U''< 0\).
									</p>
									<p>
										Individuals' problem is:
										$$\max_\alpha V(p,\alpha)$$
										By participation constraint, the individual buys a contract only if:
										$$V(p,\alpha)\geq V(p,0)$$
									</p>
									<header>
										<h3>Supply of Insurance Contracts</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										Profit of insurance company per customer: 
										$$\pi (p,\alpha)=(1-p)\alpha_1-p\alpha_2=\alpha_1-p(\alpha_1+\alpha_2)$$
										With free entry and unlimited liability.
									</p>
									<header>
										<h3>Definition of Equilibrium</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										A set of contracts such that, when customers choose contracts to maximise expected utility: <br>
										i) no contract in the equilibrium set makes negative profits; and <br>
										ii) no contract outside the equilibrium set that, if offered, will make a non-negative profit.
									</p>
									<header>
										<h3>Equilibrium with Identical Consumers</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										By free entry and perfect competition, firms make zero profit:
										$$\pi(p,\alpha)=(1-p)\alpha_1-p\alpha_2=0$$
									</p>													
									<p>	
										The equilibrium is efficient, and involves perfect insurance of the risk averse customers by the risk neutral firms. To see this, we can first substitute out \(\alpha\):
										$$\alpha_1=W-W_1$$
										$$-\alpha_2=W-d-W_2$$
										Then the firm's profit can be written as follows:
										$$\pi=(1-p)(W-W_1)+p(W-d-W_2)=W-pd-(1-p)W_1-pW_2$$
										where \(W-pd\) is the expected wealth without insurance.
									</p>
									<p>
										We can get the iso-profit line:
										$$W_2=\frac{W-pd}{p}-\frac{1-p}{p}W_1-\frac{\pi}{p}$$
										This can also be called as fair odds line. If the line passes the autarky point, then it's a zero profit line. Below the zero profit line, the firm makes strictly positive profit.
									</p>
									<p>
										On the other hand, we can write the firm's problem as:
										$$\max_{W_1,W_2}\{W-pd-(1-p)W_1-pW_2\}$$
										subject to the participation constraint:
										$$pU(W_2)+(1-p)U(W_1)\geq (=) pU(W-d)+(1-p)U(W)$$
									</p>
									<p>
										Then write the Lagrangian:
										$$\max\mathscr{L}(W_1, W_2,\lambda)=\max_{W_1, W_2}\{-(1-p)W_1-pW_2+W-pd+\lambda[(1-p)U(W_1)+pU(W_2)-(1-p)U(W)+pU(W-d)]\}$$
										Take FOCs:
										$$-(1-p)+\lambda(1-p)U'(W_1) \equiv 0$$
										$$-p+\lambda pU'(W_2) \equiv 0$$
										Then, we get the Borch Rule. The ratios of marginal utilities of income are equated across states under an optimal insurance contract:
										$$\frac{1-p}{p}=\frac{1-p}{p}\frac{U'(W_1)}{U'(W_2)} \Leftrightarrow U'(W_1)=U'(W_2)$$
										As the utility function is increasing and concave, the solution is on the 45 degree line of the wealth space (perfect insurance). For pareto efficiency, the slope of the indifference curve must equal to the
										iso-profit line.
									</p>
									<p>
										The competitive solution can be depicted as follows:
										<p align='center'>
											<img srcset="competitive-equilibrium-identical-consumers.png 320w, competitive-equilibrium-identical-consumers.png 480w, competitive-equilibrium-identical-consumers.png 800w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 280px, (max-width: 480px) 440px, 800px"  src="competitive-equilibrium-identical-consumers.png" alt="competitive equilibrium" />
										</p>
										where \(E\) is the endowment point, the solution is \(\alpha^*\) on \(F\).
									</p>
									<header>
										<h3>Imperfect Information: Equilibrium with two Classes of Consumers</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										Let \(p_H\) and \(p_L\) denote the probabilities of accident for the two classes of consumers, and \(\lambda\) be the fraction of high risks in the market:
										$$\bar{p}=\lambda p_H+(1-\lambda)p_L$$
									</p>
									<p>
										Two kinds of equilibria: pooling and separating. We will look case by case.
									</p>
									<header>
										<h4>Nonexistence of a pooling equilibrium</h4>
									</header>
									<p>
										In a pooling equilibrium, both customers buy the same contract. Look at the following graph:
										<p align='center'>
											<img srcset="no-pooling-equilibrium.jpg 320w, no-pooling-equilibrium.jpg 480w, no-pooling-equilibrium.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 280px, (max-width: 480px) 440px, 800px"  src="no-pooling-equilibrium.jpg" alt="no pooling equilibrium" />
										</p>
									</p>
									<p>
										First notice the indifference curve, the consumers' preference:
										$$V=(1-p)U(W_1)+pU(W_2)$$
										Total differentiate and FOCs:
										$$\mathrm{d}V = (1-p)U'(W_1)\mathrm{d}W_1+pU'(W_2)\mathrm{d}W_2=0$$
										$$\frac{\mathrm{d}W_2}{\mathrm{d}W_1}=-\frac{1-p}{p}\frac{U'(W_1)}{U'(W_2)}$$
									</p>
									<p>
										Notice that the slope coefficient:
										$$\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}p}\left(-\frac{1-p}{p}\right)> 0$$
										Thus, the higher the risk \((p)\), the less negative (greater) is the slope. The indifference curve is flatter. Further, notice that single crossing property holds.
									</p>
									<p>
										Now, line \(EF\) is the zero profit line, with the slope \(-\frac{1-\bar{p}}{\bar{p}}\). In equilibria, no firm will have strict negative profit. Suppose in a pooling equilibrium \(\alpha\) is offered. 
										Then, consider contract \(\beta\). Since \(\beta\) is below the high type's indifference curve but above the low type's indifference curve, only the low type will accept the contract. The blue dashed line is the zero profit line 
										if consumers are low types. Thus, the firm can make strictly positive profit. So \(\alpha\) cannot be a pooling equilibrium.
									</p>
									<p>
										One can show that for every \(\alpha\), such \(\beta\) exists. So there is no pooling equilibrium exists.
									</p>
									<header>
										<h4>Existence of separating equilibrium</h4>
									</header>
									<p>
										If there is an equilibrium, then it must be separating. Look at the following graph:
										<p align='center'>
											<img srcset="existence-of-sep-eq.png 320w, existence-of-sep-eq.png 480w, existence-of-sep-eq.png 800w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 280px, (max-width: 480px) 440px, 800px"  src="existence-of-sep-eq.png" alt="no pooling equilibrium" />
										</p>
										The set \((\alpha^H, \alpha^L)\) is the only possible equilibrium for a market with low and high risk individuals. The restrictions are satisfied by exactly one pair of contracts.
									</p>
									<p>
										Apart from the two types indifference curves and zero profit line \(EF\), \(EH\) is the zero profit line on high risk individuals, with slope \(-\frac{1-p_H}{p_H}\). \(EL\) is the zero profit line on low risk individuals
										with slope \(-\frac{1-p_L}{p_L}\).
									</p>
									<p>
										\(\alpha^H\) is easy to understand (same as above), and the low type will not deviate to \(\alpha^H\) as it is below the low types' indifference curve. But we also need \(\alpha^L\) to be
										such that the high type will not deviate. Thus, it has to be on the intersection of the two indifference curves. This is the incentive constraint.
									</p>
									<p>
										However, \((\alpha^H, \alpha^L)\) need not be an equilibrium. If the fraction \(\lambda\) (high risk individuals in the market) is small, the the overall zero profit line rotates clockwise to 
										\(EF'\) (the slope of the indifferent curve becomes more negative). Then, look at the point \(\gamma\). Both low type and the high type prefers \(gamma\), and the firm makes strictly positive profit. 
										Then, \((\alpha^H, \alpha^L)\) is not an equilibrium.
									</p>
									<p>
										We have already concluded that there does not exist a pooling equilibrium. Thus, if the fraction of the high risk individuals in the market is small, there is no equilibrium. 
										In this case, the costs to the low risk consumer of cross subsidisation (pooling) are low. This also includes the case where the probabilities of the accidents are not too different.
									</p>
									<header>
										<h3>Results</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										1. Competitive Equilibria may not exist. <br>
										2. If a competitive equilibrium exists, it is a separating equilibrium. These are what we have discussed right above. <br>
										3. Competitive equilibria are Pareto inefficient. High risk individuals exert a negative externality on low risk individuals (cross subsidisation). However, high risk individuals do not 
										benefit from this. Everybody could be weakly better off, and the low type could be strictly better off, if the high risks revealed their type.<br>
										4. If an equilibrium exists it involves nonlinear pricing. We will discuss non-linear pricing later.
									</p>
									<p>
										We can also use Wilson equilibrium or mix strategies to get existence of equilibria. Note that the pooling equilibrium in a sense that low type and high type chooses the same contract does not exist.
									</p>

									<header>
										<h2>Nonlinear Pricing and Asymmetric Information</h2>
									</header>
									<p>
										This can also be referred to price discrimination in the industrial organisation context. This is a way to screen the buyers. Here we only discuss the second degree price discrimination.
										This is also called nonlinear pricing, or discrimination by self selection.
									</p>
									<p>
										One typical nonlinear pricing is two part tariff. The total amount of money paid for consuming \(s\) units of goods is:
										$$T=f+ps$$
										We can understand the \(f\) as a fixed fee, and \(p\) is the price per usage. If divide this by \(s\), we can get the unit price:
										$$\frac{T}{s}=\frac{f}{s}+p$$
										This affine function type pricing is called nonlinear pricing in economics context, though it is still linear in mathematic context.
									</p>
									<header>
										<h3>Model (The two type case)</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										The pricing in this model can also be called as menu pricing. There are two consumer groups with preferences described by the utility function:
										$$U= \begin{cases}\tilde{\theta}V(s)-T, &\text{ if they pay } T \text{ and consume } s \\ 0, &\text{ otherwise } \end{cases}$$
										where \(\tilde{\theta}\) is a taste parameter. For a proportion \(\lambda \in [0,1]\) of consumers \(\tilde{\theta}=\theta_1\), and the remaining \(\tilde{\theta}=\theta_2\).
									</p>
									<p>
										We impose the further assumption:
										$$\theta_2> \theta_1> c$$
										where \(c\) is the producer's constant marginal cost of production. For some results, we use a particular functional form:
										$$V(s)=\frac{1-(1-s)^2}{2}$$
										where \(s \in [0,1]\). Consumers with a higher taste parameter attach a higher value to extra units of quality. In other words, at the margin, consumers of a higher type's value
										increase in consumption more. This justifies the single crossing property. In a formal argument, note that:
										$$\frac{\partial^2U}{\partial \theta \partial s}=V'(s)>0$$
									</p>
									<p>
										The difference of attitude towards quality motivates the monopolist to tailor his services to the demand of the consumers: <br>
										Group 1: Sell an amount of quality \(s_1\) against a total payment of \(T_1\). <br>
										Group 2: Sell an amount of quality \(s_2\) against a total payment of \(T_2\).
									</p>
									<header>
										<h4>First Best (Discrimination with Perfect Information)</h4>
									</header>
									<p>
										If the information were symmetric, then the monopolist's problem:
										$$\max_{s_1,s_2,T_1,T_2} \{\lambda (T_1-cs_1)+(1-\lambda)(T_2-cs_2)\}$$
										subject to: 
										$$\theta_2 V(s_2)-T_2 \geq 0 \tag{IR\(\theta_2\)}$$
										$$\theta_1 V(s_1)-T_1 \geq 0 \tag{IR\(\theta_1\)}$$
										These are the participation constraints. We can notice that these constraints must be binding at an optimum (otherwise adjust \(T_1\) or \(T_2\)). Then one has a simplified objective:
										$$\max_{s_1,s_2} \{\lambda (\theta_1 V(s_1)-cs_1)+(1-\lambda)(\theta_2 V(s_2)-cs_2)\}$$
										This is a strictly concave problem in the choice variables. So the solution \(s_1^*\) and \(s_2^*\) is characterised by the following FOCs:
										$$\theta_1 V'(s_1^*)=c$$
										$$\theta_2 V'(s_2^*)=c$$
										These conditions indicate that marginal prices equal to marginal costs. The solution is therefore efficient, but the monopolist extracts the full surplus from the consumers. The monopolists profit is:
										$$\lambda S_1(c)+(1-\lambda)S_2(c)$$
										and the consumer receives zero surplus. How to compute the surplus \(S_1\) and \(S_2\) is not important here.
									</p>
									<p>
										This can be implements by the following two-part tariffs:
										$$T_1=S_1(c)+c$$
										$$T_2=S_2(c)+c$$
									</p>
									<header>
										<h4>The Asymmetric Information Case</h4>
									</header>
									<p>
										If the monopolist cannot observe consumer types, then the efficient solution above is not incentive compatible. One can show that \(\theta_2\) prefers the bundle \(\{s_1^*, T_1^*\}\).  
										\(\theta_2\) pretends to be \(\theta_1\) to pay a lot less. Hence, the monopolist has to take care of incentive constraints.
									</p>
									<p>
										Now, the monopolist's problem:
										$$\max_{s_1,s_2,T_1,T_2} \{\lambda (T_1-cs_1)+(1-\lambda) (T_2-cs_2)\}$$
										subject to:
										$$\theta_1 V(s_1)-T_1 \geq 0 \tag{IR\(\theta_1\)}$$
										$$\theta_2 V(s_2)-T_2 \geq 0 \tag{IR\(\theta_2\)}$$
										$$\theta_1 V(s_1)-T_1 \geq \theta_1 V(s_2)-T_2 \tag{IC\(\theta_1\)}$$
										$$\theta_2 V(s_2)-T_2 \geq \theta_2 V(s_1)-T_1 \tag{IC\(\theta_2\)}$$
									</p>
									<p>
										To solve the problem, first notice that \((\text{IR}\theta_1)\) must be binding. Otherwise, one can increase both \(T_1\) and \(T_2\) to increase the monopolist's value. Further, 
										\((\text{IR}\theta_2)\) is redundant:
										$$\theta_2 V(s_2)-T_2 \geq \theta_2 V(s_1)-T_1 \geq \theta_1 V(s_1)-T_1 =0$$
									</p>
									<p>
										Next, look at the incentive constraints. We guess that only \((\text{IC}\theta_2)\) is binding, and we can solve the reduced problem and then check later:
										$$\max_{s_1,s_2,T_1,T_2} \{\lambda (T_1-cs_1)+(1-\lambda) (T_2-cs_2)\}$$
										subject to:
										$$\theta_1 V(s_1)-T_1 = 0 \tag{IR\(\theta_1\)}$$
										$$\theta_2 V(s_2)-T_2 = \theta_2 V(s_1)-T_1 \tag{IC\(\theta_2\)}$$
										Substitute out the constraints:
										$$\max_{s_1,s_2} \{\lambda (\theta_1 V(s_1)-cs_1)+(1-\lambda) (\theta_2 V(s_2)+(\theta_1-\theta_2) V(s_1)-cs_2)\}$$
									</p>
									<p>
										Take FOCs: 
										$$\theta_2 V'(s_2)=c$$
										$$\theta_1 V'(s_1)=\frac{c}{1-\frac{1-\lambda}{\lambda}\frac{\theta_2-\theta_1}{\theta_1}}> c$$
									</p>
									<p>
										One can verify that the rest of the incentive constraints is satisfied.
									</p>
									<p>
										The high consumer group consumes the efficient amount of quality: no distortion at the top. <br>
										The low consumer group consumes inefficiently little quality. This distortion is introduced to make it less attractive to the high consumer group to misrepresent their tastes. <br>
										The low consumer group receives no rent: no rent at the bottom.
									</p>
									<p>
										The optimal nonlinear pricing scheme can be implemented with a pair of two part tariffs.
									</p>
									<header>
										<h3>General case with a continuum of types</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										This part is discussed more detailed in industrial organisation context. Here is just the solution presented. 
									</p>
									<p>
										Types in \([\underline{\theta}, \bar{\theta}]\) with a density \(f(\theta)\) and CDF \(F(\theta)\).
									</p>
									<p>
										By revelation principle, considering direct mechanism is enough: consumers announce their \(\theta\) and the firm offers \(s(\theta)\) in exchange for a total payment of \(T(s(\theta))\).
										Then the firm's problem:
										$$\max_{s(\cdot), T(\cdot)} \int_{\underline{\theta}}^{\bar{\theta}} (T(\theta)-cs(\theta))f(\theta) d\theta$$
										subject to:
										$$\theta V(s(\theta))-T(\theta) \geq \theta V(s(\hat{\theta}))-T(\hat{\theta}), \forall \theta, \forall \hat{\theta} \neq \theta \tag{IC}$$
										$$\theta V(s(\theta))-T(\theta) \geq 0, \forall \theta \tag{IR}$$
									</p>
									<p>
										First, \(s(\theta)\) must be monotonic increasing. By incentive constraints:
										$$\theta V(s(\theta))-T(\theta) \geq \theta V(s(\theta'))-T(\theta')$$
										$$\theta' V(s(\theta'))-T(\theta') \geq \theta' V(s(\theta))-T(\theta)$$
										Adding up:
										$$(\theta'-\theta)(V(s(\theta'))-V(s(\theta))) \geq 0$$
										Since \(V\) is increasing:
										$$\theta' > \theta \Leftrightarrow s(\theta') \geq s(\theta)$$
										$$\theta' < \theta \Leftrightarrow s(\theta') \leq s(\theta)$$
									</p>
									<p>
										Then, we conclude that \((\text{IR})\) constraints only bind at the low end, similar to the no rent at the bottom result:
										$$\underline{\theta} V(s(\underline{\theta}))-T(\underline{\theta})=0$$
										By monotonicity, \(s(\theta)\) is differentiable in almost everywhere (in this case indeed everywhere). Then \(T(\theta)\) is differentiable. Consumers will choose to report \(\theta'\)
										optimally. Hence we have the FOC:
										$$\theta V'(s(\theta))s'(\theta)-T'(\theta)=0$$
										So, if one changes report \(\theta\) slightly, one effect is the marginal utility is going to increase slightly, multiplied by the change in allocation. The second effect is the change in payment. 
										Now, focus on the utility. This is the maximised utility:
										$$u(\theta)=\max_{\hat{\theta}}\{\theta V(s(\hat{\theta}))-T(\hat{\theta})\}$$
										Take FOC, obtained by envelope theorem:
										$$u'(\theta)=V(s(\theta))\geq 0$$
										So, the utility increased in \(\theta\) is just \(V(s(\theta))\).
									</p>
									<p>
										The next step is using the binding \((\text{IR})\) constraint for type \(\underline{\theta}\) and the above FOC to substitute out \(T(\theta)\):
										$$u(\underline{\theta})=\underline{\theta}V(s(\underline{\theta}))-T(\underline{\theta})=0$$
										By definition:
										$$\int_{\underline{\theta}}^{\theta}u'(z)dz=u(\theta)-u(\underline{\theta})$$
										$$\Leftrightarrow u(\theta)=u(\underline{\theta})+\int_{\underline{\theta}}^{\theta}u'(z)dz$$
										Thus:
										$$u(\underline{\theta})=\int_{\underline{\theta}}^{\theta}V(s(z))dz$$
										On the other hand:
										$$u(\theta) = \int_{\underline{\theta}}^{\theta}V(s(z))dz =\theta V(s(\theta))-T(\theta)$$
										Hence:
										$$T(\theta)=\theta V(s(\theta))-\int_{\underline{\theta}}^{\theta}V(s(z))dz$$
										The payment consists of two parts. The first part is gross surplus, from which the second part (information rent) is subtracted.
									</p>
									<p>
										This and the monotonicity are not only necessary conditions for incentive compatible, but also sufficient conditions. So, we can substitute into the objective function:
										$$\max_{s(\cdot)}\int_{\underline{\theta}}^{\bar{\theta}}\left(\theta V(s(\theta))-\int_{\underline{\theta}}^{\theta} V(s(z))dz-cs(\theta) \right)f(\theta)d\theta$$
										By monotonicity of \(s(\theta)\), we have \(s'(\theta) \geq 0\).
									</p>
									<p>
										Integrate by parts:
										$$\int^{\hat{\theta}}_{\underline{\theta}}\int_{\underline{\theta}}^{\theta}V(s(z))\,dzf(\theta)\,d\theta=\int^{\theta}_{\underline{\theta}}V(s(z))\,dzF(\theta)\Bigg|^\bar{\theta}_\underline{\theta}-\int^{\bar{\theta}}_{\underline{\theta}}V(s(\theta))F(\theta)\, d\theta$$
										$$=\int^{\bar{\theta}}_{\underline{\theta}}V(s(\theta))(1-F(\theta))\, d\theta$$
										Then substitute back into the objective:
										$$\max_{s(\cdot)}\int_{\underline{\theta}}^{\bar{\theta}}\left(\theta V(s(\theta))-V(s(\theta))\frac{(1-F(\theta))}{f(\theta)}-cs(\theta) \right)f(\theta)d\theta$$
										subject to:
										$$s'(\theta) \geq 0$$
										For distributions that satisfy regular condition:
										$$\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}\left(\frac{1-F(\theta)}{f(\theta)}\right) \leq 0$$
										the constraint is automatically satisfied.
									</p>
									<p>
										So, the first-order condition for a pointwise optimum is:
										$$(\theta V'(s(\theta))-c)f(\theta)=V'(s(\theta))(1-F(\theta))$$
										The lhs is the impact of a marginal increase of \(s(\theta)\) on surplus. The rhs is the impact of a marginal increase of \(s(\theta)\) on expected rent that is left to consumers. At 
										each \(\theta\), if we change the allocation slightly, all \(1-F(\theta)\) need to be given a higher rent to prevent them from deviating to consume less.
									</p>
									<p>
										Check that the pointwise optimum is monotonic, differentiating the above FOC:
										$$(\theta V'(s(\theta))-c)-V'(s(\theta))\frac{1-F(\theta)}{f(\theta)}=0$$
										Total differentiation by implicit function theory:
										$$\left(\theta-\frac{1-F(\theta)}{f(\theta)} \right)V''(s)\mathrm{d}s+V'(s(\theta))\left(1-\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}\frac{1-F(\theta)}{f(\theta)}\right)\mathrm{d}\theta=0$$
										$$\Leftrightarrow \frac{\mathrm{d}s}{\mathrm{d}\theta}=\frac{V'(s(\theta))\left(1-\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}\frac{1-F(\theta)}{f(\theta)}\right)}{-\left(\theta-\frac{1-F(\theta)}{f(\theta)} \right)V''(s)} \geq 0$$
										Thus, the allocation is indeed monotonic.
									</p>

									<header>
										<h2>Monopolistic Insurance Reconsidered</h2>
									</header>
									<p>
										The monopolistic insurance contract \(\{\alpha, \beta\}\) works as follows:
										$$w_a(\beta)=w-d+\beta$$
										\(w_a\) is the wealth conditional on an accident.
										$$w_{na}(\alpha)=w-\alpha$$
										\(w_{na}\) is the wealth conditional on no accident.
										$$\bar{\theta}> \underline{\theta}$$
										\(\theta \in \{\underline{\theta},\bar{\theta}\}\) is the accident probability. So the individuals are divided into two groups accordingly.
									</p>
									<p>
										An individual's expected utility from buying insurance contract \(\{\alpha, \beta\}\) is:
										$$U(\alpha,\beta,\theta)=\theta u(w_a(\beta))+(1-\theta) u(w_{na}(\alpha)), \text{ for } \theta\in \{\underline{\theta}, \bar{\theta}\}$$
										Thus, linear in return in each state.
									</p>
									<p>
										The insurance company offers contracts \(\{\underline{\alpha},\underline{\beta}\}\) and \(\bar{\alpha}, \bar{\beta}\) to insurants in order to maximise its profit:
										$$\pi = \lambda\left(-\underline{\theta} \underline{\beta}+(1-\underline{\theta})\underline{\alpha}\right)+(1-\lambda)\left(-\bar{\theta}\bar{\beta}+(1-\bar{\theta})\bar{\alpha}\right)$$
										The constraints are complex. However, since \(U(\alpha, \beta, \theta)\) is linear in \(u(w_a(\beta))\) and \(u(w_{na}(\alpha))\), we can let the company offer utility contracts:
										$$\bar{u}_a\equiv u\left(w_a\left(\bar{\beta}\right)\right)$$
										$$\underline{u}_{na}\equiv u\left(w_{na}\left(\underline{\alpha}\right)\right)$$
										Let \(u_a \equiv u(w-d)\) and \(u_{na} \equiv u(w)\) denote the state contingent outside option utility (without insurance). Let \(v \equiv u^{-1}\) be the inverse function of \(u\). By 
										strictly increasing and strict concavity of \(u(w)\) in \(w\), \(v\) is strictly convex in \(u(w)\) (its argument). By definition we have:
										$$v(u(w_i))=w_i$$
									</p>
									<p>
										We can then write the insurance company's problem as:
										$$\max_{\underline{u}_a, \underline{u}_{na}, \bar{u}_a, \bar{u}_{na}} \left\{\lambda [-\underline{\theta}v(\underline{u}_a)-(1-\underline{\theta})v(\underline{u}_{na})+w-\underline{\theta}d]
										+(1-\lambda)[-\bar{\theta}v(\bar{u}_a)-(1-\bar{\theta})v(\bar{u}_{na})+w-\bar{\theta}d] \right\} \tag{1}$$
										subject to:
										$$\bar{\theta}\bar{u}_a+(1-\bar{\theta})\bar{u}_{na} \geq \bar{\theta}\underline{u}_a+(1-\bar{\theta})\underline{u}_{na} \tag{2}$$
										$$\underline{\theta}\underline{u}_a+(1-\underline{\theta})\underline{u}_{na} \geq \underline{\theta}\bar{u}_a+(1-\underline{\theta})\bar{u}_{na} \tag{3}$$
										$$\bar{\theta}\bar{u}_a+(1-\bar{\theta})\bar{u}_{na} \geq \bar{\theta}u_a+(1-\bar{\theta})u_{na} \tag{4}$$
										$$\underline{\theta}\underline{u}_a+(1-\underline{\theta})\underline{u}_{na} \geq \underline{\theta}u_a+(1-\underline{\theta})u_{na}\tag{5}$$
									</p>
									<p>
										We can solve this problem by the Maskin-Riley approach. It turns out that only \((\text{2})\) and \((\text{5})\) bind. Let \(\left\{\underline{u}^*_{na}, \underline{u}^*_{a}, \bar{u}^*_{na}, \bar{u}^*_{a}\right\}\) 
										denote a solution to the problem. Some properties of the solutions: <br>
										For high enough \(\lambda\) the solution to the monopolist's problem is characterised by the following conditions (and the binding constraints):
										$$\bar{u}^*_{na}=\bar{u}^*_{a} \tag{9}$$
										$$\frac{1}{u'(v(\underline{u}^*_a))}=\frac{1}{u'(v(\underline{u}^*_{na}))}-\frac{1-\lambda}{\lambda}\frac{1}{u'(v(\underline{u}^*_a))}\frac{\bar{\theta}-\underline{\theta}}{\underline{\theta}(1-\theta)}\tag{10}$$
										No distortion at the top and no rent at the bottom. Low risk consumers receive too little insurance, as in \((\text{10})\) shows, the second part of the rhs is greater than \(0\).
									</p>
									<p>
										Whenever both consumers are served, the equilibrium utilities of the consumer with the low probability of accident satisfy \(\frac{\partial \underline{u}^*_{na}}{\partial \lambda}< 0\) 
										and \(\frac{\partial \underline{u}^*_{a}}{\partial \lambda}> 0\). The equilibrium utilities of the consumer with the high probability of accident satisfy \(\frac{\partial}{\partial \lambda}\bar{u}^*_{na}=\frac{\partial}{\partial \lambda}\bar{u}^*_{a}>0\)
